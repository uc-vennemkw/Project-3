# Project-3
The goal of this script is to automatically create desktop shortcuts to UC's 2 popular student sites, Catalyst and Canvas. Also, the script will check through 
your system and export the process name and the ID of the process to a CSV file and place it on the desktop. I chose to add the CSV because I felt like it is something
that not a lot of people realize can be a great tool to see what is running on a system. 

To run this correctly, you can either copy and paste the code into powershell ISE, or, download the code as a .ps1 and right click and run that.
